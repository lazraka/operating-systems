### Project description
Project 3A consists of exploring the EXT2 file system.

The tarball for this project includes a README file with explanations of the project and the files included in the tarball, a Makefile to package the program, a header file ext2_filesystem.h containing a description of the EXT2 file system being explored and a C source module lab3a.c that contains the code to explore the file system.

The header file ext2_filesystem.h provides the format of the file system including structures for the superblock, the group descriptors, the inodes and the directory entries. Through the use of these structure fields, the source file lab3a.c is able to navigate through the EXT2 file system and explore features of the superblock, the groups, and the entries in inodes.
